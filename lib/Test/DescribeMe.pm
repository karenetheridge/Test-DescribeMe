=head1 NAME

Test::DescribeMe - Tell test runners what kind of test you are

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Maybe you're an author test and users shouldn't run you:

  use Test::DescribeMe qw(author);

Or maybe you are a really slow test you don't want to bother most people with:

  use Test::DescribeMe qw(extended);

Or perhaps you only want to run on smokers

  use Test::DescribeMe qw(smoke);

Or a combination there of

  use Test::DescribeMe qw(smoke extended);

Or you require user input

  use Test::DescribeMe qw(interactive);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you want to run (or not run) tests under certain conditions. This 
module provides a way to identify what kind of test a test is and will skip the 
test if the matching conditions aren't met. See L</BACKGROUND> below for a 
longer description.

=head2 Usage

To describe what kind of test you are, you C<use()> this module and pass test 
types to the import list. This B<SHOULD> be done before importing L<Test::More> 
if you set explicit plans or tests will break!

Example:

  use Test::DescribeMe qw(smoke);
  use Test::More tests => 5;

(Although you probably want L<Test::More/done_testing> without explicit plans).

The available test descriptions and effects are:

=over 4

=item *

B<smoke> - This test only wants to run on smoke boxes.

=item *

B<interactive> - This test requires user interaction and should not be run 
in cases where this isn't wanted or available

=item *

B<extended> - This test should only be run if someone really wants to - as it 
may take a long time or use lots of resources.

=item *

B<author> - This is an author test and should only be run during development 
time.

=item *

B<release> - This is a release test and should onyl be run pre-release to 
ensure a build is insane.

=head2 More Control

If this doesn't provide the control you're looking for - for example, NOT 
running a test if on a smoker, see L<Test::Settings>.

=head1 BACKGROUND

With the Lancaster Consensus at the Perl QA Hackathon 2013, a 'new' system has 
been defined which provides two new test environment variables and reaffirms an 
existing one.

B<AUTOMATED_TESTING> was meant to be used by smokers, but has been abused to say 
things like "Only run this test on smokers since it takes a long time." The 
problem with this is install tools want to say "Run all tests but don't prompt 
the user" and the only way to do that is with B<AUTOMATED_TESTING>, and so they 
end up running the long running tests and wasting time.

In order to support this, B<AUTOMATED_TESTING> will once again mean 
"I am a smoker running these tests" and two new environmental variables 
B<EXTENDED_TESTING> and B<NON_INTERACTIVE> will handle the two other cases.

B<EXTENDED_TESTING> is for tests that want
